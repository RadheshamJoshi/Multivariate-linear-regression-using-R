# Multivariate-linear-regression-using-R
In linear regression there was only one indepent variable and one dependent variable whereas in multivariate regression there are many dependent variables. In this project I have applied regression model on restaurants  database. We are trying to find the how attributes like food, decor, service and east have effect on the price. 
I have used NYC dataset for this model. In this dataset the restaurants in the New York are listed.
